# Drugs-Classification-Using-ML-Models
This repository contains a project for classifying different drugs based on patient information such as age, gender, and medical conditions. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the appropriate drug for patients. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle and employs different techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification tasks.Â
