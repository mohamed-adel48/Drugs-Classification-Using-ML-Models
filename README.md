# Drugs-Classification-Using-ML-Models
This repository contains a project for classifying different drugs based on patient information such as age, gender, and medical conditions. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the appropriate drug for patients. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle and employs different techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification tasks.Â 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Drugs A, B, C, X, Y for Decision Trees](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pablomgomez21/drugs-a-b-c-x-y-for-decision-trees/data). It contains information about various patients and the corresponding drugs they were prescribed. The dataset includes the following features:
